# PhD Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the PhD Data Analysis repository! This repository contains various scripts and tools for analyzing biological data, specifically focusing on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and biofilm inhibition studies.

## Overview

This repository provides tools to perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on *C. elegans* lifespan data and analyze biofilm inhibition activity. The scripts are designed to be user-friendly, even for those with minimal programming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas lifelines matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


## Scripts and Tools

### Kaplan-Meier Analysis

- **KaplanMeier_script.py**: This script performs Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on the provided data.
- **Template.py**: Generates a CSV template for entering survival data.
- **README_Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis.md**: Instructions for using the Kaplan-Meier analysis tools.

### Biofilm Inhibition Analysis

- **scripbiofilm.py**: Analyzes biofilm inhibition data and generates visualizations.
- **scripbiofilm_alternative.py**: An alternative script for biofilm analysis with additional visualization options.

### MIC Analysis

- **MIC.py**: Analyzes Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) data and generates plots.

## Data Input

Data should be provided in the specified CSV format. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, use the `c_elegans_data_template.csv` template generated by the `Template.py` script. For biofilm analysis, ensure your data is formatted correctly in the input files.

## Visualization

The scripts generate various visualizations, including Kaplan-Meier curves and box plots for biofilm inhibition. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed to view these plots.
